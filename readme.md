An AI Agent is an LLM-based system that can reason, use tools, maintain memory, and take multiple actions autonomously to achieve a goal.

user input -> server have tools (functions) -> server give input to LLM to decide which function to call --> LLM give function name and it's arguments from the user input to server -> and server call the fucntion and give the response to LLM again to generate a better output --> LLM take the result from the server and give a better human readable output -> server send the final generated output to the user
